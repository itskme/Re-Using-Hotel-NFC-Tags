# Re-Cycling Old Hotel Cards as NFC Tags

There is a little-known trick with hotel cards. By using certain android apps and an NFC capable phone, we can either completely format the card, or, if write protected, use it to run automations! Below will cover both methods.

## Before you Begin

* Ensure you have an NFC-CAPABLE smartphone. 

* Know that this can be time consuming (30 mins+)

* make sure your hotel card does not have a black magnetic strip on the back (make sure it's NFC-based).

## 1. Check if the tag is write protected.

To do this, 

a.)    downlaod the [NFC TOOLS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en_US&pli=1) app by wakdev

b.)    go to the "write" section

c.)    add a record

d.)    text

e.)    type "1234" and tap "OK"

f.)    write / 11 bytes



After you press "write" approch your NFC hotel card. If it writes, you should be good to go!
